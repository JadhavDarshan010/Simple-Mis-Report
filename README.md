## Conclusion & Next Plan:
Fresh Mart performed well in 2025, with the Central and East regions leading sales and the Household and Bakery categories driving the most revenue. However, products like Cheese and Tea need better promotion. Summer months showed weak beverage sales, so special offers can help boost them. Focus should be on improving low-performing regions, promoting top categories, and using digital payment rewards to increase customer engagement and profit.
